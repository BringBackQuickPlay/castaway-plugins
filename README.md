## Introduction
Repository for plugins used on [castaway.tf](https://castaway.tf/)

The only entirely custom plugins here are changelevel and chat-adverts. Everything else is a plugin made by someone else. The credits for said plugins can be found unmodified at the top of each plugin's .sp file.

This is not a comprehensive list of all plugins used on the server, however it does include all the most relevant ones to the player experience such as the map voting, team scrambling, and weapon revert plugins. 

## Additional Credits
Some or all of these plugins have been modified in some way, sometimes in major ways. I do not claim credit for these plugins and all credit goes to their original creators.

* reverts.sp - This plugin is mostly a modification of bakugo's [weapon revert plugin](https://github.com/bakugo/sourcemod-plugins), however in order to add onto it I have occasionally taken some code from NotnHeavy's [gun mettle revert plugin](https://github.com/NotnHeavy/TF2-Pre-Gun-Mettle-Reverts)
* votescramble - This plugin comes from the [uncletopia plugin repo](https://github.com/leighmacdonald/uncletopia) 
* nativevotes-* - This also comes from the uncletopia plugin repo, however it seems to have only been slightly modified by them and as such original credit goes towards Powerlord and AlliedModders
